# Architecture

System context and high-level architecture diagrams.

## Documents

- `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`: bounded contexts, ownership, and communication model.
- `docs/architecture/places-service-architecture.md`: internal design of `places-service`.

## Notes

- `docs/ai/` remains the working AI instruction space.
- Stable architecture decisions are promoted here and into `docs/decisions/`.
